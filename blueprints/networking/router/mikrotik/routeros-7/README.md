# RouterOS 7 Bridge Configuration Reference

## Introduction
This collection of Markdown files serves as a configuration reference for setting up a bridge on MikroTik RouterOS 7 devices. 
It provides logically ordered tables with key-value pairs and descriptions for each stage of bridge configuration.

The goal is to help engineers quickly find the relevant configuration options and use them as a baseline for setting up or 
maintaining bridge interfaces on MikroTik devices.

## Configuration Steps (Order of Files)
The configuration process follows a logical order to ensure proper bridge setup:

1. **Bridge Creation and Basic Configuration**  
   - This file outlines the creation of the bridge interface itself. It sets the foundation for all subsequent configurations.

2. **Bridge Port Configuration**  
   - After creating the bridge, the next step is to add ports (physical or virtual) to the bridge interface.

3. **VLAN Configuration on the Bridge**  
   - VLANs are configured after the bridge and ports are set up. This step allows for segmentation and tagging within the bridge.

4. **IP Address and DHCP Configuration**  
   - Assign an IP address to the bridge and configure DHCP to dynamically assign IPs to devices within the bridge network.

5. **Firewall Configuration**  
   - Set up firewall rules to control traffic flow, ensuring security and proper packet handling within the bridge.

6. **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Configuration**  
   - Configure STP to prevent loops in the network, especially useful when multiple paths exist.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**  
   - Set up monitoring and maintenance tasks to ensure the bridge's health and efficiency.

## How to Use
1. Download all Markdown files from this collection.
2. Follow the configuration order as described above.
3. Refer to each file as you configure the bridge on your MikroTik RouterOS 7 device.
