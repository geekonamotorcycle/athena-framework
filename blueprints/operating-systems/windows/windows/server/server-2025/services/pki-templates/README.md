# RP Digi PKI Infrastructure Template

This document provides a structured template for thoroughly documenting the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) within your organization. It is part of a broader project focused on standardized, high-quality IT infrastructure documentation.

## Purpose

The PKI Infrastructure Template ensures comprehensive documentation and secure management practices for:

- Root Certificate Authorities (Root CA)
- Intermediate Certificate Authorities
- Key management procedures
- Administrative and emergency contact roles
- Disaster recovery and operational guidelines

## Document Structure

- **Root Authority Management:** Clearly identifies ownership, administration, and emergency contacts.
- **Root CA Details:** Captures technical and physical details of Root CA servers and associated hardware security modules (HSM).
- **Intermediate CAs:** Documents all essential details about intermediate certificates and their servers.
- **Operational Procedures:** Specifies certificate lifecycle management, including issuance, renewal, revocation, and recovery procedures.
- **Logging, Monitoring, and Auditing:** Defines procedures for maintaining secure logs, monitoring infrastructure, and periodic auditing.

Each section provides concise explanations and direct links to official best practices from Microsoft to ensure adherence to recognized standards.

## How to Use this Template

Replace each `TBD` placeholder with specific information relevant to your organization's PKI infrastructure. Regularly update to maintain accuracy, security compliance, and to support auditing and troubleshooting.

## References

The appendix includes direct references to official Microsoft best practices documentation to guide the management of PKI systems.
